# Medical-Dataset-Analysis-Machine-Learning-

Making prediction and calculate how accurate the dataset is based on the different algorithms.

Using python with scik

Libraries used: Sci-kit learn, Scipy, Matplotlib and Numpy

1. Loading the medical record using CSV libraries in Python.
    Using numpy to mathematically divide the dataset into two part, testing and training part. 
    
2. Use different algorithms along with most accurate and suitable parameter to calculate the accuracy of datasets.

   Classifier or algorithms used:
    - Naive Bayes Classifier
    - Decision Tree
    - KNN neighbour 
    - SVM 
  
3. Using the cross-validation to test and train the dataset for the purpose of finding means and average of accuracy.

4. Plot the result into graph for data visualization to compare which classifier along with the most suitable parameter.
